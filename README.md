# JavascriptPuzzle1

The puzzle.js file contains some code to modify. It currently meets the if statement requirements; we'd like you to modify the code so we reach the else statement.
Only the code above the if/else statement should be modified. It goes without saying that just changing the condition wouldn't be much of a challenge.

The solution should be submitted on your own branch by opening a pull request.
